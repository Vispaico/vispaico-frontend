Subdomain Pros and Cons
Using a subdomain (de.vispaico.com) for German is technically robust and allows you to treat the German site as its own project for deployment and testing.

Subdomains are supported by Google for multilingual content, but they’re treated more like separate websites than subdirectories, so you’ll need to work a bit more on SEO (like building some backlinks and optimizing metadata separately for the subdomain).​

You’ll have total freedom to adjust the code, configuration, and even underlying data for the German part without affecting your main (English) site.​

Be sure to link the two sites well (header/footer links, language switchers) and use proper hreflang tags to help search engines understand their relationship and avoid duplicate content problems.​

Technical and SEO Considerations
Cloning is safer for complex SaaS, ecommerce, or document management setups with special features you don’t want to break.

You do need to maintain both sites (bug fixes, updates), which doubles some work, but gives you maximum control and stability.​

Subdomains require additional DNS and deployment setup — Vercel’s Dashboard makes this relatively easy if you’re already deploying with them.

Performance and page load times will depend on how you build and optimize each language site, but modern frameworks and Vercel deployments handle this well if you clone the repo and keep code lean.

Practical Steps
Clone your existing Git repo to a new “vispaico-de” repo (or use a new branch).

Translate content and adjust code as needed (e.g., German text, forms, legal docs).

Set up de.vispaico.com via your DNS provider and Vercel.

Use hreflang and interlinking for SEO authority and proper crawling.

Deploy, test, and link from your main site language-switcher.

This is a proven approach for fast, risk-free rollout of multilingual sites where technical complexity or business risk exist. For ongoing updates, keep processes in place to sync feature/security changes between the main and cloned sites.

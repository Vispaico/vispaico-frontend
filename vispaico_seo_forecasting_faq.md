# SEO Forecasting & Planning — Frequently Asked Questions

## How accurate are SEO forecasts?

Real talk: 75% accurate at 12 months based on actual client data. SEO has too many variables for perfection. What matters is staying within 20% of your forecast—that's considered accurate in the industry.

Month 3 forecasts are only 45% accurate (too early). By month 6 you're at 60%. Month 9 hits 70%. By month 12, when everything's played out, you get that 75%.

We track monthly and adjust. When actual results differ by more than 20%, we identify why and update the forecast forward.

## Why do most SEO forecasts fail?

Three reasons:

**Optimism bias.** "We'll rank #1 for everything, traffic grows linearly, no algorithm changes." Fantasy. 

**Hidden methodology.** You ask how they got the numbers and they go quiet. No transparency. No data backing it up.

**Ignoring reality.** Competitors move. Algorithms shift. Content underperforms sometimes. Most forecasts pretend none of that happens.

We don't do any of that. We show conservative, likely, and optimistic scenarios. We explain the math. We account for what actually happens in the real world.

## What data do you need to forecast accurately?

Minimum 12 months of real performance history:
- Organic traffic trends
- How fast rankings improved
- Content indexing rates
- Backlink acquisition pace

Plus current state:
- Your actual rankings (positions 1-50)
- How many pieces of content you have
- Domain authority
- Technical health

Plus your plans:
- How many articles you'll publish (realistically)
- Link building targets
- Technical improvements coming
- Your budget

Without 12 months of history, we can't forecast. We can plan, but we can't predict.

## Why three scenarios instead of one number?

Because one number is a lie.

**Conservative (70% confidence):** 35-45% traffic growth. Assumes slower improvements, underperforming content, algorithm changes, normal setbacks.

**Likely (50% confidence):** 60-80% traffic growth. Based on your actual historical pace. Normal execution. Minor hiccups included.

**Optimistic (30% confidence):** 100-130% traffic growth. Perfect execution, everything goes right, no disruptions.

One scenario looks smart until month 6 when you're wrong. Three scenarios set actual expectations and prove we know what we're talking about.

## How does publishing frequency affect the timeline?

Publishing more = faster growth, but not linearly.

**10 articles/month:** +30% traffic month 6, +65% month 12

**20 articles/month:** +50% traffic month 6, +110% month 12

**5 articles/month:** +15% traffic month 6, +35% month 12

Why the jump? Articles take 2-3 months to index, then 4-6 more months to rank. The growth compounds. Month 6 isn't half of month 12—it's when the first batch starts ranking hard.

## Can you guarantee specific traffic numbers?

No. Anyone who does is lying.

What we guarantee: honest forecasting, monthly tracking, and adjustments when reality differs from plan. If an algorithm update hits (and it will eventually), we adjust the forecast and extend the timeline.

We estimate keyword ranking probability instead of guaranteeing rankings. Position 11-20 has roughly 40% chance of page one in 12 months. Position 31-50 has 10%. Not 100%, but realistic.

## What happens if results fall short of forecast?

We track it. Monthly.

Compare actual traffic vs. forecast. Actual rankings vs. predictions. Content published vs. plan. Links acquired vs. target.

If you're off by more than 20%, we dig in. Was it an algorithm shift? Did content underperform? Did competitor activity spike? We document it and adjust the forecast forward.

This is where credibility lives—not in being right the first time, but in admitting misses and fixing them.

## How do you adjust for domain authority and competition?

Each target keyword gets a ranking probability, then we adjust based on:

**Domain authority comparison:** If your domain is stronger than competitors, +10% to ranking probability. Weaker? -10%.

**Content quality advantage:** If your content is demonstrably better than competitors, +15%. If it's the same, no adjustment.

**Backlink pace:** If you're building links faster than competitors, +10%. Slower? -10%.

These adjustments make the forecast specific to your situation instead of generic.

## What's the difference between your forecasting and what other agencies do?

Most agencies:
- Give one optimistic number
- Don't explain how they got it
- Never track actual results
- Disappear if they're wrong

We:
- Show three scenarios (conservative, likely, optimistic)
- Explain the exact methodology
- Track monthly and adjust
- Own it when forecasts need updating

Our 8 clients over 2 years gave us real data to test this. 75% accuracy isn't luck. It's methodology.

## How often do you update the forecast?

Monthly. We compare actual results to forecast, identify variances, adjust forward.

If you're hitting targets, forecast stays similar. If algorithm hit you or content underperformed, we adjust the timeline and growth expectations.

It's not one prediction. It's monthly recalibration based on reality.

## Is SEO forecasting worth the time?

Yes. Here's why:

- You know what to expect (sets realistic timeline)
- You can justify budget (shows ROI potential)
- You can track progress (not just guessing monthly)
- You can adjust early (not surprised in month 9)

The forecast is also the plan. It shows what needs to happen when for growth to work. It's not just prediction—it's a roadmap.

## Who should get a forecast done?

Anyone doing SEO who:
- Has 12+ months of historical data (baseline required)
- Wants realistic expectations (not hype)
- Plans to actually execute (not just plan)
- Wants to track progress month-to-month

If you've been live for less than a year, we can plan and estimate, but we can't accurately forecast yet. Wait, collect data, then we forecast.

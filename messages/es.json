        "question": "What happens after my website is built?",

      {
        "question": "Do you provide ongoing support and maintenance?",
        "answer": "We include 30 days of technical support and 7 days of revisions with every project. After that, ongoing maintenance is optional - many clients prefer to handle updates themselves since we build user-friendly sites."

        "question": "Do you do SEO?",
        "answer": "Every website we build is SEO-optimized from day one - proper titles, meta descriptions, fast loading, mobile-friendly. We don't do ongoing SEO campaigns, but your site will be found on Google."
      },
      {
        "question": "What about hosting and domains?",
        "answer": "Included for 1 year with most services. We register your domain, set up hosting, security/SSL, and configure everything. After 1 year, you can renew with us or take it anywhere - you own it all."

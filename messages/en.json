        "question": "Why should I choose you over a local web agency?",
        "answer": "Agencies charge $5k-15k and take 3-6 months with endless meetings. We deliver the same quality in days, not months, for a fraction of the cost. Plus you own everything - no monthly hosting fees or maintenance contracts."

        "question": "What happens after my website is built?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Do you provide ongoing support and maintenance?",
        "answer": "We include 30 days of technical support and 7 days of revisions with every project. After that, ongoing maintenance is optional - many clients prefer to handle updates themselves since we build user-friendly sites."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I see examples of your work?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Do you have a Technical Support policy?",

      {
        "question": "Do you have a Revisions policy?",

      {
        "question": "Do you have a money back policy?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Do you do SEO?",
        "answer": "Every website we build is SEO-optimized from day one - proper titles, meta descriptions, fast loading, mobile-friendly. We don't do ongoing SEO campaigns, but your site will be found on Google."
      },
      {
        "question": "What about hosting and domains?",
        "answer": "Included for 1 year with most services. We register your domain, set up hosting, security/SSL, and configure everything. After 1 year, you can renew with us or take it anywhere - you own it all."

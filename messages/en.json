      },
      {
        "question": "Why should I choose you over a local web agency?",
        "answer": "Agencies charge $5k-15k and take 3-6 months with endless meetings. We deliver the same quality in days, not months, for a fraction of the cost. Plus you own everything - no monthly hosting fees or maintenance contracts."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I don't like the design?",
        "answer": "You get 7 days of unlimited revisions after delivery. We keep tweaking until you're happy. Most clients love the first version, but we're not done until you are."

      {
        "question": "Do you handle content and copywriting?",
        "answer": "Yes. If you don't have content ready, we'll write it for you. Just tell us about your business in your own words - we'll turn it into professional web copy that converts."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens after my website is built?",
        "answer": "You own everything. The website, domain, hosting, and all files. You can update it yourself or hire anyone to maintain it. No vendor lock-in, no ongoing fees unless you want our help."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you provide ongoing support and maintenance?",
        "answer": "We include 30 days of technical support and 7 days of revisions with every project. After that, ongoing maintenance is optional - many clients prefer to handle updates themselves since we build user-friendly sites."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I see examples of your work?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! Visit our <a href=\"/portfolio\" className=\"text-yellow-400 hover:text-yellow-400 underline\">Portfolio</a> to see real projects we've built for restaurants, contractors, consultants, and online stores."

        "question": "How do I get started?",
        "answer": "Choose your service and fill out the form. You'll get a contract and invoice within an hour. Pay when you're ready to start, and we'll have your site live within the promised timeframe."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you have a Technical Support policy?",
        "answer": "YES, 30 days of technical bug fixes included after project delivery. If something breaks due to our code, we fix it free."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you have a Revisions policy?",
        "answer": "YES, 7 days of unlimited revisions after delivery. Change colors, text, layout - whatever you need to make it perfect."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you have a money back policy?",
        "answer": "YES, full refund if we can't deliver what we promised within 24 hours of supposed completion. We've never had to use it, but it's there for your peace of mind."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you do SEO?",
        "answer": "Every website we build is SEO-optimized from day one - proper titles, meta descriptions, fast loading, mobile-friendly. We don't do ongoing SEO campaigns, but your site will be found on Google."
      },
      {
        "question": "What about hosting and domains?",
        "answer": "Included for 1 year with most services. We register your domain, set up hosting, security/SSL, and configure everything. After 1 year, you can renew with us or take it anywhere - you own it all."
